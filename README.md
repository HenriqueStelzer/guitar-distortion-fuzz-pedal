# Fuzzzzzzz - A guitar pedal
### My take on the classic fuzz face circuit

The Fuzzzzzzz pedal is an eletronic device designed for processing audio signals and shaping them into a heavily distorted fuzz face like sound. It features:
* Three control knobs for gain, equalizing and output level
* Assymetric clipping
* True bypass
* Quality power supply decoupling
* Plenty of room for modding

  The circuit is composed of a gain controlling input stage with a controlable non inverting amplifier that buffers and boosts the signal with gain of 6dB to 21.6dB. The gain stage has a topology inspired in the classic fuzz face guitar pedal but modded to have a lower noise floor, use common components and a sligthly different flavour of clipping. The output stage is composed of a recovery/buffering stage with tone control for boosting high-mids frequencies and a final output level control.
